SmartFit is a lightweight, web-based tailoring management tool that streamlines the entire customer order process—from measurement capture to real-time order tracking—without the overhead of a full database. Clients simply fill out a clean, mobile-friendly form to submit their name, contact details, custom measurements, and design notes; the data is then saved instantly to a JSON file on the server. On the dashboard side, tailors can view a visually consistent, paginated list of incoming orders, complete with clear “order cards” that display each client’s information at a glance. Built with Flask and vanilla JavaScript (with CORS support), SmartFit’s simplicity ensures fast deployment, minimal dependencies, and easy maintenance—while defensive coding around file I/O and network errors guarantees reliability. The result is a “nice,” intuitive experience that saves time, reduces measurement mistakes, and keeps every order perfectly organized.
